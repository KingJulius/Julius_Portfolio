## [Project 3: Digit Classification Using Real-Time Image Feed](https://github.com/KingJulius/Real-Time-Digit-Classification)
- Built using Python
- Uses Convolution Neural Networks and Open CV
- This model has been trained using around 1016 images per class label.
- Functionality: Using Real Feed Data it gets from the camera if a number is detected, it displays the number with the best match rate along with the likelihood rate.
